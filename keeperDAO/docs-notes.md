# [KeeperDAO notes](https://docs.keeperdao.com/reference/)


<br>

**KeeperDAO uses the power of Coordination to create more efficient markets by capturing and recycling MEV to the 
users and protocols that create it.**

<br>

**KeeperDAO is a decentralised and coordinated Keeper commonwealth making the Ethereum network more egalitarian, profitable, and secure for all the actors involved.**

<br>

## Keepers

* Bots that observe Ethereum, and other blockchains, to faciliate sorts of transactions, such as arbitrage, liquidations, auctions.
* Keepers compete with each other in a zero-sum game, transforming Ethereum into a highly zero-sum game.
* Inside KeeperDAO, keepers don't need to compete - but coordinate and capture on-chain profits efficiently. DeFi users, protocols, market makers can bring their activity to KeeperDAO and gain a portion of the profits as a reward.

### The Hiding Vault

A generalized liquidation-mitigation lending and borrowing NFT product. 
* The first platform supported by Hiding Vaults is Compound Finance.
