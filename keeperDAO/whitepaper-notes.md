# Notes on [KeeperDAO's whitepaper: Governance by Apparent Consensus](https://www.keeperdao.com/files/gov-beigepaper.pdf)

* Article describes a new form of self governance for DAOs, called "apparent consensus".
* It can be implemented on- or off-chain, and uses direct token-weighted voting - but it's not plutocratic.
* It has no quorums, and tolerates low turnout without losing legitimacy
* Defaults to a state of expert delegation, withtout requiring any special technology
* It respects minority rights, and allows dishonest actores to be routed around
* When consensus is high, decisions are rapid; when it's low, it take more time

### Introduction

Apparent consensus is implemented in three stages:

* Crowd consensus: a member of the general public makes a proposal and post it ona public forum.
* Sophon consensus: expert members of the DAO analyze the proposal and publs=ish a recomendation.
* Tokenholder consensus: following Sophon consensus, they are offered the chance to object to the recommendation.

### Summary

* The properties if the blockchain, the effects of tokenized stake, and the threat of fork, render the effects of voting meaningless and instead support consensus democracy as the natural mode of governance.
* The most widely-practiced form of consensus governance calls the "rule of non-opposition", which creates an "apparent consensus".
* A token-weighted vote is a compatible way to signal a lack of consensus.
* On a meritocracy basis, limited positional authority for coordination makes production communities more competitive.
